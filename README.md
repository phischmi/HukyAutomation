# HukyAutomation

This is my approach on automating the Huky 500T Roaster.

It consists of a replacement of the original AC fan, a 3d-printed adapter-ring for the new fan, the use of several Phidgets devices and an DIY fan-controller based on an ATtiny85.

The whole setup is described in ArtisanBlog.
